# Privacy Policy
Last Updated: June 2025

Our Commitment to Privacy
Django Files is an open-source, self-hosted file management app designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect or store any personal data.

What Data Do We Collect?
App Usage
The Django Files iOS app does not collect any user data.

Any data processed by the app remains on your self-hosted server.

Crash Reporting
The iOS app may collect anonymous crash data (e.g., error logs, device type) to improve stability.

We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics, services provided by Google, to collect and analyze app usage data and crash reports. This helps us improve app stability and performance. These services may collect information such as your device type, operating system version, app usage patterns, and crash details. This data is processed in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy, which you can find below.

*   [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

Website
The Django Files website (hosted on GitHub Pages) does not track visitors or collect analytics data.

Your Choices
You can disable crash reporting in your device settings:

iOS: Settings → Privacy & Security → Analytics & Improvements

Android: Settings → Google → Ads → Opt-out of Ads Personalization
