Privacy Policy
Last Updated: March 2025

Our Commitment to Privacy
Django Files is an open-source, self-hosted file management app designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect or store any personal data.

What Data Do We Collect?
App Usage
The Django Files iOS app does not collect any user data.

Any data processed by the app remains on your self-hosted server.

Crash Reporting
The iOS app may collect anonymous crash data (e.g., error logs, device type) to improve stability.

This data is handled by Apple (iOS) through their default crash reporting service.

Website
The Django Files website (hosted on GitHub Pages) does not track visitors or collect analytics data.

Your Choices
You can disable crash reporting in your device settings:

iOS: Settings → Privacy & Security → Analytics & Improvements

Android: Settings → Google → Ads → Opt-out of Ads Personalization
